            <p class="firstpara">Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans made from seeds of Coffea plant
                species. It is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily
                due to its caffeine content, and is one of the most popular drinks in the world. Usually for Italians
                coffee is more than something to drink because it’s an important moment in our everyday routine</p>
            <br>
            <p class="firstpara">From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce unroasted green coffee. The
                seeds are then roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water
                before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced
                coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French
                press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk and cream are often
                used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</p>
